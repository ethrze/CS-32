CS 32 code and projects. 

All ye current CS32 students lurking here after W15 and thinking about peeking at code.

I've been to the dean of students office to send transcripts, and trust me, it's not fun. Even the lady who works reception is having a bad time. 

Also, I'm not very good at this class. Don't say I didn't warn you.
