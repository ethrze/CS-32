1. I /think/ Steg::hide works right now. The classes that should be working are the ones in BinaryConverter and Compressor. HashTable is a bugfest. I left it for last of all. 

2. I /think/ big O is on point for all working functions. 

3. 
As I said, HashTable happened to be my lowest priority, but I'll try and give you a picture of how I was trying to implement these?

HashTable set():
Hash the key, look in the bucket for identical keys, if found, update the capacity, if not, add Node to bucket. 

HashTable touch():
Every Node has an age. Permanent nodes are -1 to make it really obvious. This function goes looking for the indicated Node, if it finds it, it sets it's age back to zero, and then it ages everyone elseâ€” only one element can be zero at a time. 

HashTable discard():
Looks for the indicated Node, removes it from the Bucket it's in, calls its destructor.
